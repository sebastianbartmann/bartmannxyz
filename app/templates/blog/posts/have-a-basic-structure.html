        While it might sound nice to have everything structured.<br/>
        Have everything put into algorithms, systems, machines.<br/>
        It is not easy to maintain all those machines.
        <br/>
        I have had, for example, a complex redirection system of all my email adresses.
        <br/><br/>
        If you are not able to forget about your system for months, come back and still
        be able to maintain it, it's a shitty system.
        <br/><br/>
        Either it is very well documented, or basic enough but still valuable for you
        to easily use and change it.
