					I founded Bluelake in 2016 to help small and medium-sized businesses with their online
					presence. Through this, I learned many things and realized that it's difficult in the
					fast-paced online world to use the latest technologies and be profitable at the same
					time. Technical debt is often underestimated. That's why I have developed a love-hate
					relationship with WordPress. It's backwards compatible and therefore full of technical
					debt, but also stable and effective for small and medium-sized businesses.
